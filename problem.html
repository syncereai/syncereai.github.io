            The hotel industry is facing a massive labor problem. They can’t find enough staff to keep up, and they’re paying more than ever to try to fix it.

            <br>
            <br>

            On average, hotels spend $50,000 per room annually on operations, and 50% of that goes to labor costs. For a typical 200-room hotel, that’s $5M per year spent on labor alone. Yet 76% of hotels are still understaffed, with housekeeping roles being the hardest to fill.

            <br>
            <br>

            What makes matters worse is that hotels have increased wages by 20% in recent years to entice people to work in housekeeping, but it hasn’t been enough. There are still 100k+ vacant housekeeping jobs in the U.S. alone currently, because people don’t want physically demanding, low-paying jobs with little to no career growth.
            
            <br>
            <br>

            We’re building robots to solve this problem for hotels. 

            <br>
            <br>

            Our robots will perform all core housekeeping tasks (making beds, cleaning bathrooms, tidying rooms, etc.) at a cost of $1,000 per month, which is 3–4x cheaper than a human housekeeper.
        
            <br>
            <br>

            These robots are ready to work around the clock to help hotels operate more efficiently, improve guest experiences, and increase profits.
