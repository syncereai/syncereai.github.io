            The hotel industry is facing a massive labor crisis. They can’t find enough staff to keep up, and they’re paying more than ever to try to fix it.

            <br>
            <br>

            To quantify the cost of this problem for hotels, it can be broken down into two key parts:

            <ol>
                <li>Hotels spend $50,000 per room annually on operations<sup>1</sup>, and 15% of that goes to housekeeping labor costs. For a typical 200-room hotel, that’s $1.5M per year spent on housekeeping labor alone.</li>
                
                <!-- <br> -->
                <br>

                <li>76% of hotels are understaffed<sup>2</sup>, with housekeeping roles being the hardest to fill. This shortage forces hotels to leave 10-20% of rooms unbooked<sup>3</sup>, costing them $1.5M annually in lost revenue for a 200-room hotel (at $150 average revenue per room per day)<sup>4</sup>.</li>
            </ol>
<!-- 
            <br>
            <br> -->

            What makes matters worse is that hotels have increased wages by 20% in recent years to entice people to work in housekeeping<sup>5</sup>, but it hasn’t been enough. There are still 100k+ vacant housekeeping jobs<sup>6</sup> in the U.S. alone currently, because people don’t want physically demanding, low-paying jobs with little to no career growth.

            <br>
            <br>

            The result? Higher labor costs, and fewer rooms booked that’s costing a typical 200-room hotel $3M every year.

            <br>
            <br>

            We’re building robots to solve this problem for hotels. 

            <br>
            <br>

            Our robots will perform all core housekeeping tasks (making beds, cleaning bathrooms, tidying rooms, etc.) at a cost of $1,000 per month, which is 3–4x cheaper than a human housekeeper.
        
            <br>
            <br>

            These robots are ready to work around the clock to help hotels operate more efficiently, improve guest experiences, and increase profits.
