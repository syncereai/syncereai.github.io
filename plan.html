        <section class="updates-section">

        Our goal is to create a robot that handles everyday chores like cleaning bathrooms, making beds, dusting, and emptying garbage to make daily life easier and free up people’s time. 
        
        <br>
        <br>

        However, bringing such a robot straight into homes isn’t realistic right now in 2024. That is because: 1) current technology doesn’t yet support the full complexity of household tasks; 2) privacy concerns make it difficult to place robots with cameras and sensors in people’s private spaces; and 3) high production costs mean that, like a car, the robot would be expensive, which is hard to justify points 1 and 2.
        
        <br>
        <br>

        To overcome these challenges, we need to gather large amounts of high-quality, real-world data to train our robots and AI models. Our robots need to practice and improve in realistic environments, but in a setting where privacy concerns are minimized. For these reasons, we will begin by deploying robots in hotels.
        
        <br>
        <br>

        Hotels address the above 3 challenges directly. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        First, hotels are ideal for training and gathering data because they have high guest turnover and several rooms per property, which introduces a variety of habits and room usage patterns all in a similar, domestic setting. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Second, hotels solve the privacy challenge because guests expect housekeeping to occur while they’re out of the room. This allows our robot to perform tasks and gather valuable data without intruding on anyone’s privacy. 
        
        <br>
        <br>

        Third, hotels are ready to invest in these robots because 1) 76% of hotels are currently short-staffed, even as sales and occupancy have returned to pre-pandemic levels, and 2) guests expect higher cleanliness standards post-COVID. This leaves hotels struggling to meet demand without overworking staff or reducing services. More details <a href="problem.html">here</a>.
        
        <br>
        <br>

        Therefore, the plan is to start by focusing on hotel housekeeping, in order to refine our robots’ core abilities for cleaning, organizing, and human-robot interaction in these environments. 
        
        <br>
        <br>

        Over time, the public will become familiar with these robots as trusted and effective tools. At that point, they will begin to view robots as luxury appliances that they want in their homes.
