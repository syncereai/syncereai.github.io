        <b>Reason 1: The path to general purpose robotics begins with single purpose robotics.</b>
        <p>
            Laundry folding is the ideal starting point for home robotics for two key reasons. First, it generates the most valuable data for learning soft object manipulation, which is the core challenge for robots operating in real homes. Second, it addresses a household chore that lacks any good automation alternative. This makes it a problem people actively want solved.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a robot to be useful in the home, it must safely and intelligently interact with soft, deformable objects. This includes clothing, bedding, furniture, and human contact. The challenge lies in tactile sensing. The ability to feel and adapt cannot be fully developed in controlled environments. It must be learned through interactions with the unpredictable variability of real life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Laundry folding forces exactly this type of learning. Every pile of laundry is different. Each item varies in shape, size, material, and behavior. Each home presents unique challenges. No other home task produces data of this quality or relevance for teaching a robot how to handle soft objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            From an adoption perspective, laundry folding is also one of the few household tasks with no easy alternatives. It is repetitive, time-consuming, and widely disliked. You can buy a dishwasher or a robot vacuum, but there is no convenient, affordable machine that folds laundry. This makes it an obvious candidate for automation and an easy system for people to welcome into their homes.
        </p>

        <b>Reason 2: Laundry folding is the only home task that unlocks soft object manipulation at scale.</b>
        <p>
        There are two reasons why laundry folding is the right starting point for building useful home robotics. First, it generates the most valuable data for soft object manipulation, which is the core challenge for robots operating in real homes. Second, it is one of the only household chores without any good automation alternatives, making it a problem people actively want solved.
        </p>
        <p>
        Let's start with the data. For a robot to be useful in the home, it needs to interact safely and intelligently with soft, deformable objects. That includes clothing, bedding, furniture, and people. The key challenge here is tactile sensing. The ability to feel is what connects intelligence with the physical world. This cannot be mastered in controlled environments. It has to be learned through interaction with real-world variability. Laundry folding forces exactly this type of learning. Every pile of laundry is different. Each item varies in shape, size, material, and behavior. Each home presents new challenges. No other home task generates data of this quality or relevance for teaching a robot to handle soft objects.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now consider adoption. Laundry folding is also one of the few household tasks with no easy alternatives. It is repetitive, time-consuming, and nearly everyone dislikes doing it. You can buy a dishwasher or a robot vacuum, but there is no convenient or affordable machine that folds laundry. This makes it an obvious candidate for automation. People will welcome a robot that solves this problem well.
        </p>

        <b>Reason 3: The aging crisis can only be solved by bringing care into the home.</b>
        <p>
        Now here's where things get big-picture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Globally, populations are aging. Birth rates are falling, life expectancy is rising, and the number of available caregivers cannot keep pace. The World Health Organization projects a shortage of 18 million healthcare workers by 2030. Healthcare systems are already under strain, and building enough hospitals to meet demand is not realistic.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time, most people want to age in their own homes. This is where they feel most safe, independent, and dignified. But real in-home care is not just video calls or medication reminders. It requires physical assistance with mobility, daily activities, and basic medical care.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where the work from Reasons 1 and 2 connects. The hardware and intelligence we are developing today, beginning with a laundry-folding robot, will create a trusted, capable robotic presence in the home. It will master soft object interaction, earn trust, and provide a foundation for more advanced in-home care capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without this path, there is no scalable solution to the aging crisis. General-purpose healthcare robots will not appear overnight. They will evolve from single-purpose systems that have already proven their value and reliability in the home.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is why starting now, and starting with Lume, is inevitable.
