    <main>
        <b>Reason 1: The path to general purpose robotics begins with single purpose robotics.</b>
        <p>
            We all imagine a future with Rosie-from-The Jetsons-style robots in the home. But no technology starts fully formed. Before the iPhone, there were standalone cameras, calculators, and MP3 players. Each had to mature before they could be combined.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is even more true for robotics. Building a robot that can handle every household task requires vast amounts of real-world data to train safe and reliable AI models. Without this data, general-purpose home robots are not practical.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, the most successful home robot is the robot vacuum. It solves a single problem effectively in real environments. Attempting to build a robot that can do everything would fail because the range of tasks is too broad, the technical challenges too great, and trust and privacy concerns remain unresolved.
        </p>
        <p>
            The right approach is to start with a focused system that solves one real problem, delivers value, improves through real-world use, and clearly communicates its capabilities. This clarity is only possible when the robot is presented as a single-task system, with transparent messaging about what it can and cannot do. When people understand what to expect, trust and adoption follow.
        </p>
        <p>

        <b>Reason 2: Laundry folding is the only home task that unlocks soft object manipulation at scale.</b>
        <p>
        There are two reasons why laundry folding is the right starting point for building useful home robotics. First, it generates the most valuable data for soft object manipulation, which is the core challenge for robots operating in real homes. Second, it is one of the only household chores without any good automation alternatives, making it a problem people actively want solved.
        </p>
        <p>
        Let's start with the data. For a robot to be useful in the home, it needs to interact safely and intelligently with soft, deformable objects. That includes clothing, bedding, furniture, and people. The key challenge here is tactile sensing. The ability to feel is what connects intelligence with the physical world. This cannot be mastered in controlled environments. It has to be learned through interaction with real-world variability. Laundry folding forces exactly this type of learning. Every pile of laundry is different. Each item varies in shape, size, material, and behavior. Each home presents new challenges. No other home task generates data of this quality or relevance for teaching a robot to handle soft objects.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now consider adoption. Laundry folding is also one of the few household tasks with no easy alternatives. It is repetitive, time-consuming, and nearly everyone dislikes doing it. You can buy a dishwasher or a robot vacuum, but there is no convenient or affordable machine that folds laundry. This makes it an obvious candidate for automation. People will welcome a robot that solves this problem well.
        </p>

        <b>Reason 3: The aging crisis can only be solved by bringing care into the home.</b>
        <p>
        Now here's where things get big-picture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Globally, populations are aging. Birth rates are falling, life expectancy is rising, and the number of available caregivers cannot keep pace. The World Health Organization projects a shortage of 18 million healthcare workers by 2030. Healthcare systems are already under strain, and building enough hospitals to meet demand is not realistic.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only way to close this gap is to bring healthcare into the home. In fact, most people want to age at home, where they feel safe, independent, and dignified. However, today’s in-home care is largely limited to telemedicine video calls and basic medication reminders. Real care requires physical interaction. To truly scale home healthcare, we will need robotic systems that allow doctors to perform physical exams and provide hands-on care remotely.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where the work from Reasons 1 and 2 connects. The hardware and intelligence we are developing today, beginning with a laundry-folding robot, will create a trusted, capable robotic presence in the home. It will master soft object interaction, earn trust, and provide a foundation for more advanced in-home care capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without this path, there is no scalable solution to the aging crisis. General-purpose healthcare robots will not appear overnight. They will evolve from single-purpose systems that have already proven their value and reliability in the home.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is why starting now, and starting with Lume, is inevitable.
